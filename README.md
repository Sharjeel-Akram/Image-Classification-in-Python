# Image-Classification-in-Python

We were given some training data andsome data for validation. It means we have to train a machine that can learndata then validate another data. And the challenging part was this that we had to use only MLPClassifier of Sci-kit library of python.

1. Functions in Code:

- Train-x-final()
- Train-y()
- val-x-final()
- val-y()
- MLP Classifier()
